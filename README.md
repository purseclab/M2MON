# M2MON
MMIO based security reference monitor. 

Please see for the paper and working of the monitor: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/khan-arslan

Note: I will be pushing the code in current state soon. The plan is to clean it up so people can use the plugin/monitor with configurable parameters.
I plan to leave the benchmarking code which could be useful for people using the same platform (which is unlikely since the platform is discontinuted, but
will give the idea.
